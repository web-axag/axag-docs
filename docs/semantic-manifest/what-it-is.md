# What Is the Semantic Manifest?

The Semantic Manifest is a **structured JSON document** generated from AXAG annotations. It serves as the intermediate artifact between annotated UI elements and MCP tool definitions.

## Purpose

The manifest:
1. **Catalogs** all annotated operations in a structured format
2. **Normalizes** annotation data into a consistent schema
3. **Enables discovery** — agents query the manifest to find available operations
4. **Serves as input** for MCP tool generation
5. **Provides a validation target** for CI/CD pipelines

## Structure

## Manifest vs Annotations

| Aspect | Annotations | Manifest |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Format | HTML attributes | JSON document |
| Location | Inline in UI code | Standalone file |
| Scope | Single element | Entire page/application |
| Consumer | Build tools, extractors | Agent runtimes, validators |
| Mutability | Changed by developers | Generated from annotations |

The manifest is a **derived artifact**. The annotations are the source of truth.
