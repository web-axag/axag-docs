# Affordances

In UX, an affordance is a property of an object that indicates how it can be used — a button affords clicking, a slider affords dragging.

In AX, affordances are **declared capabilities**. An AXAG-annotated element declares what operations it affords to agents through its `axag-intent` and `axag-action-type` attributes.

## Visual vs Semantic Affordances

| Visual Affordance | Semantic Affordance |
|------------------|---------------------|
| A button shape suggests "clickable" | `axag-action-type="mutate"` declares "invocable operation" |
| A text field suggests "typeable" | `axag-parameter-type="string"` declares "accepts text input" |
| A dropdown suggests "selectable" | `axag-parameter-type="enum"` declares "accepts constrained value" |

## Agent-Facing Affordances

For agents, affordances MUST be:
- **Explicit** — Declared through annotations, not inferred from appearance
- **Typed** — Carrying parameter type information
- **Scoped** — Bounded by declared context
- **Constrained** — Governed by declared validation rules
