# Safety Boundaries

Safety boundaries are explicit declarations that control how and when operations can be executed. They prevent agents from performing dangerous actions without appropriate safeguards.

## Safety Dimensions

### Risk Classification

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `none` | No risk — read-only, no side effects | Product search |
| `low` | Minor risk — easily reversible | Adding item to cart |
| `medium` | Moderate risk — state changes that require attention | Updating user profile |
| `high` | Significant risk — financial or data impact | Processing payment |
| `critical` | Maximum risk — irreversible, high-impact | Deleting an account |

### Confirmation Requirements

Operations classified as `high` or `critical` risk SHOULD require explicit confirmation before execution.

```html
<button
  axag-intent="account.delete"
  axag-risk-level="critical"
  axag-confirmation-required="true"
  axag-confirmation-message="This will permanently delete the account and all associated data."
>
  Delete Account
</button>
```

### Approval Requirements

Some operations require multi-party approval before execution:

```html
<button
  axag-intent="payment.refund"
  axag-risk-level="high"
  axag-approval-required="true"
  axag-approval-roles='["finance_manager"]'
  axag-approval-count="1"
>
  Issue Refund
</button>
```

### Rate Limits and Cooldowns

```html
<button
  axag-intent="email.send_bulk"
  axag-risk-level="medium"
  axag-rate-limit="100/hour"
  axag-cooldown="60s"
>
  Send Campaign
</button>
```

## Why Safety Boundaries Are Non-Negotiable

An agent without safety boundaries is equivalent to giving every user root access. Without explicit risk declarations, agents cannot distinguish between browsing products and deleting accounts.
